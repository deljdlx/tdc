# GitHub Copilot Instructions

## BEFORE EVERY TASK (Mandatory)

⚠️ **YOU MUST read these files FIRST at the start of every task:**

1. `doc/ai-agent-instructions.md`
2. `doc/ai-code-style.md`
3. Reference `doc/prompts/` and `doc/stack.md` as needed

These are the **source of truth** for:

- code style
- naming conventions
- contribution quality bar
- validation steps
- anti-patterns to avoid

Then at the start of every chat session, you must confirm that you have read and understand these instructions. You can say something like "I have read and understand the instructions in `doc/ai-agent-instructions.md` and `doc/ai-code-style.md` and will follow them for this task."

## Mandatory Shared Instruction Set

1. Read `doc/ai-agent-instructions.md`
2. Read `doc/ai-code-style.md`

Treat these two files as the source of truth for:

- coding style
- validation steps
- contribution quality bar
